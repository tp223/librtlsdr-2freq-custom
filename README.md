# librtlsdr for 2-Frequency-Reception

## Description
Modified librtlsdr (*rtl_sdr* command) to enable seamless switching of frequency during reception.
This is based on the async_rearrangement branch of librtlsdr.

This lib enables TDOA localization with RTL-SDRs, when a reference transmitter is used for synchronization. More information:

## Usage
*rtl_sdr -f <frequency 1> -h <frequency 2> -n <num_samples frequency 1> -m <num_samples frequency 2> <out_filename>*

receives first <num_samples> IQ samples at <frequency 1> (in Hz), then <num_samples> IQ samples at <frequency 2>, then again <num_samples> at <frequency 1> without interruption. For help and more options type *rtl_sdr*.

Example Usage:
*rtl_sdr -f 200e6 -h 100e6 -n 1e3 -m 1e4 record.dat*
receives first 1000 IQ samples at 200 MHz, then 10000 IQ samples at 100 MHz without interruption, resulting in 11000 samples in total.


## Build Instructions
1. navigate to main folder librtlsdr-2freq/
2. *mkdir build*
3. *cd build*
4. *cmake ../*
5. *make*

binaries (rtl_sdr) can then be found in build/src/
